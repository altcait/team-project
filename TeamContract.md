## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Discord as our primary communication channel.

* Team members will respond to messages within 3 hours on weekdays.

* Team members will notify the rest of the team if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, or if they have to miss lecture or lab.

* All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive i.e. actively listening to each team member's ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute.

## Work Quality
* All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.

* Members agree to review each otherâ€™s work constructively before submission.

* Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.

---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible.

* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

---
## Conflict resolution

* If conflict arises, the team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. If the issue is not resolved, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

## Accountability

* Each team member agrees to complete their share of the work in a timely manner and to seek assistance from TAs/instructors if they require it
